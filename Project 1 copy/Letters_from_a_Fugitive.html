            <div>Lars Westergren, explorer and murderer, spent seven years escaping justice through his knowledge of byways and shortcuts in the Bounds. Throughout that time he wrote regularly to his daughter, possibly in part to taunt his pursuers.</div>
            <p>A year with the Légion de Seuil, patrolling the Bounds, until he deserts; a month in the Priory of Captains in Morbihan; seven days, or so he claims, in Ys behind the wave…</p>
            <p>Cornered at last by his pursuers, Westergren writes that he will 'attempt the Paths of the Sun'. He doesn't seem sanguine about his chances, and indeed, this is his last letter. An editor's note adds that Westergren's whereabouts or end remain unknown, although he was supposedly sighted at the 'Christmas Market' in Vienna - the negotiations between invisible underworld figures that happen each year there - in 1929.</p>
