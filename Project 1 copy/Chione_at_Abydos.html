        <div class="text">A play dealing with the nine-year sojourn of a snow-goddess in the Thracian city of Abydos, by 'Apollo Fireweaver'. In English, published in 1892; purportedly from an older Greek text.</div>
        <div class="text">The entity called 'Chione' arrives in a blizzard and demands the city gates are barred. As Abydos falls under her spell, the dead return, but do not speak...</div>
        <div class="text"> For eight years the city is a place of slow death, frosty ecstacy and silent beauty, but in the ninth year a Conspiracy of Shouts is mounted against the quiet that Chione demands. The conspirators open the city gates, and a scarred man comes to drag Chione out by the hair. Summer returns, but the conspirators die of remorse.</div>
