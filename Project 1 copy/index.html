    <h1>Hush House Library</h1>
    <h2>Books are the memory that does not die.</h2>
    <div>
        Hush House is a library with a long and storied history, one of only nine libraries where mortals are permitted to study forbidden texts. (Of course, mortals have found ways to study such texts outside of these libraries, but Hush House's importance remains).
        This House is the centerpiece of <a href="weatherfactory.biz">Weather Factory</a>'s game Book of Hours, which I absolutely adore. Collected here are texts from that game and its predecessor, Cultist Simulator, along with additional information and commentary.
