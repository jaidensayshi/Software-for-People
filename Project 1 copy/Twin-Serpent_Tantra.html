            <br><br>Just before the outbreak of the Great War, 'Alexander Sparrow' - almost certainly a pseudonym - published leaflets claiming the influence of 'Snake Princes' on world affairs. The text called the Twin-Serpent Tantra was his primary inspiration.
            <br><br>The Tantra describes the Great Hooded Princes - a dynasty of unclear origin - engaging in prayers, sacrifices and poetry in honour of the Key-Serpent, the Crossroads-Twins and the Mirror-Queen. 'Nagi encircles; Nagi arises from wounds; Nagi spares those who are already harmed.'
            <br><br>The Great Hooded Princes are described as having 'escaped from the history of their death to a history where they yet live'. The text claims that there are now one hundred and eight of them, but - in one of many instances of twinnedness - before they crossed from their death chronicle, there were only fifty-four.
