            <br><br>The first volume of Teresa Galmier's examination of parallels in the mystic dreams of artisans.
            <br><br>The parallels in mystic dreams experienced by carpenters, masons and other artisans, and what they purport to reveal about the architecture of the world. Surprisingly mordant and even funny. No-one has ever explained why Galmier devoted herself to this quixotic exploration of artisan's dreams.
            <br><br>'Time and again we hear of the Wood, which rises from the world's foundation. All trees reach for light. What does the Wood reach for? Is there a difference between light and Light? I think the key to dreams of the Wood might be one of these - the one that isn't exactly real.'
