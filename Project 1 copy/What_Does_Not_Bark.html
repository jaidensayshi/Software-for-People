            <div>Alexander Probst writes warily of 'Calyptra' - a law, principle or society which prevents the dissemination of dangerous knowledge.</div>

            <p>'Calyptra is said to make exceptions specifically for the libraries of the Watchman's Tree. Does it make those exceptions so the Hours can make use of them?'</p>
