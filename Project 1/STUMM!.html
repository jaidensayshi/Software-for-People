    <h3>STUMM!</h3>
    <p><i>A can of nitrate film labelled STUMM! - 'Silent' or, perhaps, 'Mute'. The director's name, 'Jernik Krosse', is shakily appended.</i></p>
    <p><b>Language:</b> English. <b>Type:</b> Film reel. <b>Source:</b> Oriflamme's Auction House (Cultist Simulator).</p>
    <p>I'm reading: <i>The film rattles through the projector, glows silently on the wall. It is the story of a foolish student of forbidden sciences, who recruits a dancer to entice the Dead back into the world through a flaw in its skin. It's a fiction, but here on a title card is laid out the Operation of the Declining Sun...</i></p>
    <p>I've read: <i>The Rite is depicted in chilling detail. Here is the flaw in the world, an Influence shimmering in luminous paint. Here is the dancer establishing an irresistible rhythm. Here the scholar recites the Operation; and now the misty dead whirls through the flaw to consume him! The film closes on the dancer's watchful eyes. Had she intended it all from the start?</i></p>
