    <h3>Chione at Abydos</h3>
    <p><i>A play dealing with the nine-year sojourn of a snow-goddess in the Thracian city of Abydos, by 'Apollo Fireweaver'. It enjoyed success in London in its 1892 edition, when it was republished from - apparently - an older Greek text.</i></p>
    <p><b>Language:</b> English. <b>Source:</b> Congregation of St Felix of Sch√ºren (Cultist Simulator). <b>Period:</b> Barionial. </p>
    <p>I'm reading: <i>The entity called 'Chione' arrives in a blizzard and demands the city gates are barred. As Abydos falls under her spell, the dead return, but do not speak...</i></p>
    <p>I've read: <i>For eight years the city is a place of slow death, frosty ecstasy and silent beauty, but in the ninth year a Conspiracy of Shouts is mounted against the quiet that Chione demands. The conspirators open the city gates, and a scarred man comes to drag Chione out by the hair. Summer returns, but the conspirators die of remorse.</i></p>
